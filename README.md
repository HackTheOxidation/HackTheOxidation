### Hacking the World into a better place

Who is this? Yet another wannabe developer?

That's actually quite accurate, but actually I aim to be part of the next generation of systems programmers,
who can code up whatever they imagine from scratch without having to rely on complicated frameworks and cumbersome tools.

#### Describe yourself! Immediately!

I'm a Pythonista turned C++-\<insert-missing-denonym\> and Ada-afficionado, true FOSS-lover (reads GNU Emacs and Linux user), who always loves to do some serious functional programming.
