### Hacking the World into a better place

Who is this? Yet another wannabe developer?

That's actually quite accurate.

#### Describe yourself! Immediately!

I'm a Pythonista, true FOSS-lover (reads GNU Emacs and Linux user), part C++-\<insert-missing-denonym\>, 
slightly Rustacean, occasional Haskeller and F#-\<something\>, who always loves to do some serious functional programming.

Please, check out:

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently playing with Functional Programming Languages like `Haskell`, `F#` and `Erlang`.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on some fun projects.
